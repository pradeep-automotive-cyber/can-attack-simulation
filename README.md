# CAN Attack Simulation – Automotive Cybersecurity

## Overview
This project demonstrates common CAN bus attacks used in automotive cybersecurity,
including message injection, replay attacks, and flooding (DoS),
using Linux SocketCAN.

## Objectives
- Understand CAN bus insecurity by design
- Demonstrate message injection
- Perform replay attacks
- Analyze CAN flooding behavior

## Tools & Technologies
- Linux (WSL + Ubuntu)
- SocketCAN
- can-utils (candump, cansend, cangen, canplayer)

## Attack Scenarios
- CAN message injection
- CAN replay attack
- CAN flooding (DoS)

## Status
🚧 In progress – labs and documentation updated as learning progresses
